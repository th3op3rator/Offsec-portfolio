All content in this repository is for educational and authorized security testing purposes only.
 - No attacks were performed against systems without explicit permission
 - Vulnerabilities are demonstrated using labs, CTF Platforms, Self-Hosted enviornments, or responsibly desclosed targets
 - This portfolio follows ethical hacking principles, OWASP guidelines, and responsible disclosure practices

ANY MISUSE OF THIS MATERIAL IS STRICTLY PROHIBITED!!!

Purpose of This Portfolio
-----------------------------------
This repository documents my hands-on experience in offensive security, Including:
  - Real-world attack methodologies
  - Custom tooling and automation
  - Bug Bounty-style vulnerability discovery
  - Red team and penetration testing techniques
  - Clear documentation and reproducible proof-of-concepts
The goal is to demonstrate practical skill, not just theoretical knowledge.

Core Skill Areas Covered
----------------------------------
- Web Application Security
- API & GraphQL Hacking
- Network & Active Directory Attacks
- Linux & Windows Privilege Escalation
- Exploit Development Fundamentals
- Bug Bounty & Responsible Disclosure
- CTF Problem Solving
- Offensive Security Automation

Reconnaissance & Enumeration
----------------------------------
Folder: /Recon

Focuses on identifying attack surface before exploitation.
